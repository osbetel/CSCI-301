; To convert a string into pig latin, we must first produce a list form of the string, like java where it is "string here".split(" ").
; Splitting the string by spaces gives an array (or a list in Scheme) ["string", "here"] and then we produce a loop
; The loop then processes every element of the array individually
; Also need a way to determine the first character of a word to see if it is a vowel.
; If vowel, then simply concat a "way" to the end of the word.

; In order to convert a string to its pig latin form, I'll have to convert a string into a list of characters and move them around that way
; 


;(define (isVowel string)
;(define (splitString string)
;(define (pigify string)
;  
; should make use of two functions. In the form ifVowel() then pigify-v, else if notVowel() then pigify-c
;)

;(define (pigify-vowel string)
;(define (pigify-consonant string)
